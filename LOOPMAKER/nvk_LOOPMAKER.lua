Changelog:
    2.4.0
        IMPORTANT: Removing support for Reaper 6. To use this script, you must upgrade to REAPER 7 or higher. Older versions can be downloaded from the full repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickvonkaenel/nvk-ReaScripts/main/index.xml
        Using time selection for loop start and end is now an optional setting rather than the default behavior
        Certain project default pitch modes could cause issues with shepard tones. Now pitch mode is set to use elastique pro when using the shepard tone feature.
        Removing legacy v1 version of the script. Existing v1 licenses now work with v2.
