Changelog:
    1.12.2
        Crash when dragging favorite results to sort them
    1.12.1
        Backspace now focuses search field
    1.12.0
        Dependencies moved to nvk_SHARED
        In palette mode, large font sizes and zoom settings could cause the controls to be off screen
        New startup options section: moving relevant settings to this area, adding option to load last folder selection
        In persistent mode, the last folder selection no longer gets saved by default (setting added to restore last folder selection in either mode if desired)
    1.11.3
        Improvements to how folder colors are displayed
    1.11.2
        Crash when removing project directories individually
        Removing individual project directories could have removed incorrect folder in rare cases
        Option to rescan project directories on startup
        Crash when opening the script for the first time with no config (whooooops)
    1.11.1
        FX and Folders Sidebar now collapsible headers instead of option to hide
        Dividers and new folders get added at end of all selected folders to the same parent folder as the last selected folder
    1.11.0
        Upgraded to ReaImGui 0.9
        Folder coloring
        Fixed: adding random fx from right-click menu of folder could add incorrect folder fx
        Option to hide fx sidebar
        Slight tweak to search algorithm so that results with the same word match multiple times are not scored higher
        Close preferences window when closing script (still stays open in persistent mode)
        You can now drag the All folder to a different position if you want to have the script open to a different folder by default. It will always open the first folder in the list.
        Folder dividers
        Betting crash handling
        Multi-selection of folders - results will show all items from selected folders
        Parent folders - selecting them will show all items from their children
        Fix for escape key not clearing search field on newer versions of ReaImGui
        Order of results when dragging multiple results is preserved
    1.10.7
        Fixed: Media folders being scanned for project files in subdirectories (loading subprojects)
