    # nvk_THEME

    nvk_THEME is a premium Reaper theme in the style of the nvk.tools suite of scripts. It was designed by the talented Gwen Terrien (@terromino). It is not only an improvement on the look and feel of Reaper, but it also adds additional functionality with custom transport, track FX, and channel output buttons as well as an automatic track coloring script for the ultimate Reaper aesthetic.
