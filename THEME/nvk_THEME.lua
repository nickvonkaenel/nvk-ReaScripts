    # nvk_THEME

    nvk_THEME is a premium Reaper theme in the style of the nvk.tools suite of scripts. It was designed by the talented Gwen Terrien (@terromino). It is not only an improvement on the look and feel of Reaper, but it also adds additional functionality with custom transport, track FX, and channel output buttons as well as an automatic track coloring script for the ultimate Reaper aesthetic.

Changelog:

        Reduce large gradient color jumps with folders with less than 3 child tracks
        A few minor track color theme tweaks
    1.1.1
        Refactoring child track color gradients. Now allows for both gradient modes simultaneously and for control over the child track colors without a gradient.
        Optimized track color performance
        New script: Track Colors - Insert track and apply colors. Improves default insert track behavior and also applies the nvk_THEME track colors so that there aren't any UI flashes. Can also be used instead of the manual color apply script if you only want updates when a new track is added.
